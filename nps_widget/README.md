# NPS Widget code test
This is a test designed for developers wanting to work on the Kapiche product.
This is designed to give us a feel for where your JavaScript knowledge is at
and how you do taking a design through to implementation.

## The task
Implement [this design](https://zpl.io/scene/2EKyody) as a single page app using VueJS.

A quick snapshot of the design is below:

Please implement this in a shareable, non-public format and send it to us when
you are done. There should be a command to run your app
(something like npm run dev for example). Please don't post your code on the public 
internet. It makes our job much harder!

## The Details
* The login page should accept any valid email address and any non-empty password to
  give access.
* Data for the task is in this repo called `NPS-mock-data.csv`.
* These pages are designed for desktop only and should work on
  [>1%](https://browserl.ist/?q=%3E1%25).
* If you need clarifications, please contact ryan -AT- kapiche.com
